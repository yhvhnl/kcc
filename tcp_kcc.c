/* ---- tcp_kcc.c : TCP KCC (Kalman Congestion Control) v1.0 ------------------ */
/*
 * KCC: Kalman Congestion Control v1.0
 *
 * A TCP congestion control module for shared-bandwidth VPS environments
 * (e.g. 1-10 Gbps multi-tenant hosting) combining the BBRv1 state machine
 * (Cardwell et al. 2016) with a single-state Kalman filter (Kalman 1960)
 * for propagation-delay estimation.
 *
 * Kernel BBR practice (tcp_bbr.c) uses a sliding-window minimum of recent
 * RTT samples to estimate base propagation delay (`min_rtt_us` / `min_rtt_stamp`).
 * This approach is simple and O(1) per ACK, but exhibits three well-known
 * pathologies: (a) upward bias under persistent queue pressure, because
 * the window always includes queued RTTs; (b) winner-takes-all unfairness
 * among competing flows, since each flow tracks an independent min window;
 * and (c) slow convergence after path changes, because the window must
 * drain stale samples before the true minimum emerges.  KCC replaces the
 * sliding-window min with a single-state Kalman filter that estimates
 * true propagation delay as a latent state, separated from queuing delay
 * and measurement noise by the filter's stochastic model.
 *
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLES
 *
 *   Congestion control algorithms must balance throughput, latency,
 *   fairness, and loss tolerance.  KCC takes a pragmatic approach:
 *
 *   1. BBRv1 PROVIDES a well-understood state machine (STARTUP, DRAIN,
 *      PROBE_BW, PROBE_RTT) with proven pacing and gain-cycling
 *      strategies.  KCC adopts these mechanisms without modification,
 *      preserving compatibility with the BBR congestion-control framework
 *      and its empirical validation across diverse network paths.
 *
 *   2. The KALMAN FILTER augments the BBRv1 foundation by estimating
 *      true propagation delay separately from queuing delay and
 *      measurement jitter.  A more accurate min_rtt estimate yields
 *      tighter BDP computation, better-calibrated CWND, and more
 *      stable pacing — all of which improve bandwidth utilisation
 *      and reduce unnecessary queue buildup.  Kernel BBR's
 *      sliding-window min_rtt is simple and cheap but inherently
 *      biased under persistent queue; the Kalman filter provides an
 *      unbiased estimate with quantified uncertainty (p_est),
 *      enabling confidence-gated decisions that the windowed-min
 *      approach cannot support.
 *
 *   3. Intra-KCC fairness is actively maintained: the Kalman filter
 *      converges all KCC flows sharing a bottleneck to a consistent
 *      propagation-delay estimate, eliminating the winner-takes-all
 *      feedback loop that can cause severe unfairness in pure BBR
 *      multi-flow deployments.  In kernel BBR, each flow independently
 *      tracks its own min_rtt window; flows with lower apparent delay
 *      claim more bandwidth, creating persistent unfairness that grows
 *      with flow count.  KCC's shared-convergence design eliminates
 *      this pathology at the estimator level.  Inter-algorithm
 *      dynamics (BBR, CUBIC, Reno) are left to the standard TCP
 *      competitive equilibrium — KCC neither prioritises nor
 *      penalises external flows.
 *
 *   The metrics that guide development: throughput, latency (P95/P99),
 *   retransmit efficiency, convergence time, and jitter.  The Kalman
 *   extensions aim to improve each of these relative to the BBRv1
 *   baseline without sacrificing robustness.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE
 *
 *   BBRv1 state machine augmented with a single-state Kalman filter
 *   for propagation-delay estimation.  Key deviations from kernel BBR
 *   (tcp_bbr.c) with rationale for each:
 *
 *   - Kalman filter for min_rtt (x_est, p_est) instead of sliding-window min.
 *     Kernel BBR: windowed min tracked as u32 with update-on-lower-sample.
 *     WHY: Windowed min is biased upward under persistent queue; cannot
 *     separate prop delay from queuing delay.  Kalman filter yields unbiased
 *     estimate with known error covariance, enabling confidence-gated qboost,
 *     dynamic PROBE_RTT, and proactive ECN backoff.
 *     BENEFIT: Lower baseline latency, tighter BDP, fairer multi-flow convergence.
 *
 *   - Directional state update: positive innovations (queue noise) are
 *     skipped — only negative innovations (clean samples) and
 *     qboost-triggered path-change updates enter the filter.
 *     Kernel BBR: every RTT sample (up or down) can update min_rtt when
 *     the window cycles.
 *     WHY: RTT increases are dominated by queuing delay, not prop-delay
 *     changes.  Filtering positive innovations avoids polluting x_est with
 *     queue noise.  Negative innovations (RTT drops) are likely cleaner
 *     samples of the true propagation delay.
 *     BENEFIT: More stable min_rtt estimate under variable queue depth.
 *
 *   - Confidence-gated qboost: large innovations only trigger gain reset
 *     when the filter is converged (p_est <= converged_p_est), with a
 *     configurable cooldown (kcc_kalman_qboost_cdwn, default 15 samples)
 *     between events to prevent runaway on lossy paths.
 *     Kernel BBR: no equivalent mechanism.
 *     WHY: When path delay drops significantly (route change), the filter
 *     must converge quickly.  Uncordinated gain resets on noisy paths
 *     cause oscillations.  The convergence gate and cooldown add hysteresis.
 *     BENEFIT: Fast route-change adaptation without oscillation on lossy paths.
 *
 *   - Adaptive process/measurement noise (Q, R) based on jitter and min_rtt,
 *     with BBR-S covariance-matched estimation as a slow calibration channel.
 *     Kernel BBR: no noise parameters — windowed-min approach has no
 *     stochastic model.
 *     WHY: Fixed Q/R require per-path tuning.  Following BBR-S (2021),
 *     adaptive noise estimates let the Kalman filter operate across diverse
 *     environments (datacenter to satellite) without reconfiguration.
 *     BENEFIT: Deployability across heterogeneous paths without manual tuning.
 *
 *   - Outlier gating with dynamic threshold derived from jitter_ewma.
 *     Kernel BBR: 10% outlier rejection in bandwidth estimator (bw filter),
 *     but no RTT outlier rejection beyond the window-min mechanism itself.
 *     WHY: Single spurious RTT samples (scheduling delay, TSO batching,
 *     interrupt coalescing) would corrupt a standard Kalman update.  The
 *     dynamic threshold tracked via jitter EWMA rejects outliers while
 *     adapting to path conditions.
 *     BENEFIT: Robustness to measurement artifacts without a fixed threshold.
 *
 *   - Hysteresis on Kalman takeover (3 confirming rounds).
 *     Kernel BBR: min_rtt always active — no handover needed.
 *     WHY: Prevents a single clean RTT from immediately overriding the
 *     windowed-min baseline before the filter has demonstrated consistent
 *     improvement.  Three consecutive confirming rounds provide statistical
 *     confidence.
 *     BENEFIT: Smooth transition without false positives on single clean samples.
 *
 *   - Cold-start overshoot correction at sample_cnt == 1.
 *     Kernel BBR: no equivalent — windowed min refills gradually.
 *     WHY: The first Kalman update after a long idle period may use stale
 *     or inflated initial x_est.  The correction bounds the initial cwnd
 *     to prevent burst-induced losses.
 *     BENEFIT: Avoids initial burst loss on long-idle connections.
 *
 *   - Gain decay in PROBE_BW (opt-in via kcc_cycle_decay_mask, disabled
 *     by default, conserving full probe intensity).
 *     Kernel BBR: pacing_gain in PROBE_BW always follows the 8-entry gain
 *     table (1.25, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) — no decay.
 *     WHY: In shallow-buffer paths, 1.25x probe gain can cause packet
 *     loss.  When p_est is low (filter converged) and qdelay is near-full,
 *     reducing probe intensity avoids unnecessary drops.  Disabled by
 *     default to match kernel BBR's probe aggressiveness.
 *     BENEFIT: Optional loss reduction on shallow-buffer paths.
 *
 *   - Proactive cwnd reduction when Kalman covariance is low and qdelay
 *     rises (ECN backoff).
 *     Kernel BBR: reacts to packet loss or ECN only after the event.
 *     WHY: With a converged filter (low p_est), the estimated qdelay is
 *     reliable enough to proactively reduce send rate before ECN marking
 *     or loss occurs.  Uses the same BBR_UNIT scaling for gain reduction.
 *     BENEFIT: Prevents queue buildup and ECN marking proactively.
 *
 *   - Dynamic PROBE_RTT interval based on Kalman covariance p_est.
 *     Kernel BBR: fixed 10-second PROBE_RTT interval (probe_rtt_duration_ms).
 *     WHY: Fixed interval is too aggressive for low-latency paths
 *     (unnecessary throughput dips) and not aggressive enough for
 *     high-jitter paths (stale min_rtt).  Scaling interval inversely with
 *     p_est lets converged filters probe less often, uncertain filters
 *     probe more often.
 *     BENEFIT: Adaptive PROBE_RTT frequency tuned to estimation uncertainty.
 *
 *   - Long-Term (LT) bandwidth estimation triggered on loss events.
 *     Kernel BBR: max-bw filter (`struct minmax bw`) collapses during
 *     sustained losses — the windowed max drops as old high-bw samples
 *     expire.
 *     WHY: LT-BW preserves a separate bandwidth estimate through lossy
 *     periods (e.g., wireless), then smoothly transitions back when the
 *     window recovers.  Similar to BBRv3's LT-BW approach.
 *     BENEFIT: Maintains send rate through lossy periods, faster recovery.
 *
 *   - Single-flow detection with automatic BBR-pure fallback.
 *     Kernel BBR: no equivalent — always uses windowed min regardless
 *     of flow count.
 *     WHY: When only one KCC flow is detected on a path, the Kalman
 *     convergence benefits are moot, and the filter overhead can be
 *     avoided.  KCC falls back to BBR-pure min_rtt tracking.
 *     BENEFIT: Reduced CPU overhead on single-flow paths.

 * kcc_kf_discount_num — Global fair-share discount numerator.

 * When multiple connections share a bottleneck link, the global KF

 * being injected into each new connection, preventing over-allocation
 * across competing flows.
 *
 * --- Dessert-speed design rationale ---
 *
 * The effective initial-speed coefficient is:
 *
 *   coeff = (discount_ratio) / high_gain
 *         = (num / den) / 2.89
 *
 * where high_gain ≈ 2.89 is the BBR STARTUP pacing multiplier.
 * This places the initial injection at a conservatively low fraction
 * of the estimated fair-share bandwidth: enough to accelerate
 * cold-start meaningfully, low enough that STARTUP's 2.89× gain
 * does not overshoot into bufferbloat within the first 2–4 RTTs.
 *
 * Note that in practice the first 1–2 RTTs cannot physically saturate
 * even a low dessert speed: tcp_write_xmit enforces an initial CWND
 * of TCP_INIT_CWND (10 segments, ≈ 15 KB) for every new connection.
 * CWND only grows when remote ACKs arrive, so the dessert speed is
 * an upper bound on pacing rate — the actual throughput is CWND-limited
 * until sufficient ACKs have been received to open the window.
 *
 * The adjustable range is 35–75 (num / den = 35–75% of fair share):
 *
 *   num | coeff  | characteristic
 *   ----|--------|-------------------------------
 *    35 | 12.1%  | maximum safety, worst-path
 *    50 | 17.3%  | centre axis (default)
 *    75 | 25.9%  | mathematical dessert sweet spot
 *    80 | 27.6%  | mathematical rate ceiling (should not exceed)
 *
 * At 50 % centre: 50 / 100 / 2.89 ≈ 17.3 %.  This is the midpoint
 * between "too slow to help" and "too fast to be safe" — the KCC

 * kcc_rtt_mode — Selects the model RTT strategy for BDP calculation.
 *
 * Mode 1 (FILTER, default): use x_est_us directly (the raw Kalman / sliding-
 *      window filter estimate).  Recommended for production WAN / VPS
 *      deployments because:
 *
 *      a) Route-change resilience — When a BGP reroute increases physical RTT
 *         (e.g., 50 ms → 100 ms), the Kalman gain K_k reacts within a few
 *         RTTs and pulls x_est_us to the new path latency.  MIN mode deadlocks
 *         on the old min_rtt_us (50 ms) until the window expires; BDP is
 *         computed from the stale minimum, effectively cutting the pipe in
 *         half and creating a throughput cliff until the window rotates.
 *
 *      b) Built-in defenses — Outlier gating rejects RTT samples inflated by
 *         queue spikes (CoDel pass-through, ACK compression) before they
 *         enter the innovation step.  Adaptive Q/R noise matching reduces
 *         K_k when measurement noise is high, so the filter's gain naturally
 *         damps during transient bloat and keeps the estimate near the true
 *         propagation delay.
 *
 *      c) PROBE_RTT decoupling — FILTER mode computes BDP from x_est_us, not
 *         min_rtt_us, so the periodic PROBE_RTT drain is unnecessary for BDP
 *         accuracy.  The kcc_probe_rtt_decouple mechanism suppresses PROBE_RTT
 *         when the Kalman filter is healthy and reactivates it as an on-demand
 *         safety net when p_est signals divergence.
 *
 *      Result: zero throughput cliffs, no global PROBE_RTT sync collapses,
 *      application-level latency spikes eliminated.
 *
 * Mode 0 (MIN): return min(x_est_us, min_rtt_us).  Conservative: guarantees
 *      BDP never inflates beyond the windowed minimum.  Use when verifying
 *      kernel-module stability before switching to FILTER, or on links
 *      where RTT is known to be truly static.

 *
 * BBRv1's PROBE_RTT is a necessary evil for the window-based min_rtt
 * approach — the window cannot track true propagation delay unless the pipe
 * is periodically drained to 4 packets.  In FILTER mode the Kalman filter
 * replaces the window entirely, so the periodic self-mutilation loses its
 * mathematical necessity.
 *
 * Mode 0: Traditional PROBE_RTT — every 10 s, cwnd is clamped
 *      to 4 packets for ~200 ms to drain the pipe and measure min_rtt.
 *      This causes a periodic throughput cliff (the BBR "sawtooth").
 *
 * Mode 1 (decouple, default): When kcc_rtt_mode == FILTER, the PROBE_RTT entry
 *      trigger evaluates Kalman filter health via kcc_kalman_needs_recalibration():
 *
 *      - Kalman healthy (p_est <= kcc_recal_p_est_thresh):
 *        PROBE_RTT is suppressed.  The filter tracks true propagation
 *        delay via outlier gating and adaptive Q/R noise estimation
 *        without draining the pipe.  In normal operation p_est converges
 *        to ~p_est_floor (4--10), far below the 250k threshold, so
 *        PROBE_RTT suppression is the steady state.  Zero throughput
 *        cliffs, zero PROBE_RTT sync collapses.
 *
 *      - Kalman diverged (p_est > kcc_recal_p_est_thresh):
 *        PROBE_RTT is reactivated as a safety net.  This triggers when

 *
 * Additional KCC deviation: BDP floor logic.  When the Kalman filter has
 * NOT converged and model_rtt < kcc_bdp_min_rtt_us, the RTT is floored to
 * kcc_bdp_min_rtt_us (default 1 us, effectively disabled).  Kernel BBR has

 * produce min_rtt_us = 0.
 * BENEFIT: Robustness on loopback and datacenter paths with < 1 us RTT.

 * kcc_update_dyn_probe_interval - Recompute the dynamic PROBE_RTT interval
 * based on Kalman error covariance p_est (Kalman 1960).
 * @ext: extended state (modified in-place).
 *
 * Mapping function (linear interpolation):
 *
 *   p_est <= p_est_floor                        -> interval = 2.5x dyn_max (75s, hyper-converged)
 *   p_est_floor < p_est <= converged_p_est      -> linear from 2.5x → 1.0x dyn_max
 *   converged_p_est < p_est < band*conv          -> linear from dyn_max → base
 *   p_est >= band * converged_p_est              -> interval = base (conservative)
 *
 *   interval = base + (max_jif - base) * (4*conv - p_est) / (3*conv)
 *
 * Rationale: when the Kalman filter has high confidence (low p_est),
 * the propagation delay estimate is stable, and PROBE_RTT can be
 * performed less frequently — reducing periodic throughput drops.
 * At extreme confidence (p_est near floor), the interval extends to
 * 2.5x dyn_max (75s), further reducing the performance penalty of
 * periodic min_rtt probing.  When p_est is high (low confidence), the
 * interval reverts to the base (conservative) value.

 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Design reasoning
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * (1) No inflight bounds — follow kernel BBR v5.4
 *
 * Kernel BBR's bbr_set_cwnd() has no explicit inflight lo/hi bounds.
 * BBRv2 added a cwnd floor (1.25x BDP) and ceiling (2.0x BDP), but
 * BBRv1/v5.4 relies on natural ACK-clock convergence:
 *
 *   full_bw:   cwnd = min(cwnd + acked, target)
 *   STARTUP:   cwnd = cwnd + acked
 *
 * The ceiling is implicit — ACK arrival rate is the send rate.
 * The floor is bbr_cwnd_min_target (4 segments) — keepalive, not performance.
 *
 * Why the inflight bounds were removed:
 *
 * Lower bound (1.0x BDP):
 *   At cruise, gain == BBR_UNIT so BDP × 1.0 equals BDP itself —
 *   the bound is neutral.  At drain, pacing_gain = 88/256 ≈ 0.344x,
 *   the bound would prevent queue drainage — which is the entire
 *   purpose of the drain phase.
 *
 * Upper bound (2.0x BDP):
 *   Kernel BBR has a 2x BDP inflight cap in the *pacing* path
 *   (bbr_inflight_hi_from_bw), not the cwnd path.  Placing it in
 *   the cwnd path violates the original design's separation of concerns.
 *
 * (2) Kalman BDP — kcc_bdp() uses Kalman RTT, not raw min_rtt
 *
 * Kernel BBR's bbr_bdp() uses bbr_min_rtt() — the smallest RTT seen
 * within the sliding window.
 *
 * The problem with min_rtt is not imprecision — it is systematic bias:
 *
 *   ACK compression    multiple ACKs can land in the same frame,
 *                      distorting RTT measurement timestamps
 *   TSO aggregation    bulk data sent in a single frame → falsely short RTT
 *   GRO / LRO          receiver-side merging → timestamp displacement
 *   timer granularity  kernel jiffies or hrtimer resolution injects noise
 *
 * These mechanisms conspire to produce a minimum value that is
 * *smaller than the physical propagation delay*.  Computing BDP
 * from this minimum gives a pipe that cannot hold — inflight can
 * exceed it without loss, proving the true pipe is larger.
 *
 * Kalman RTT is not "a smoother min_rtt".  It estimates the
 * *expectation* of the propagation delay, P(true_delay | all_samples) —
 * a statistically unbiased quantity.  Every sample contains noise;
 * the Kalman filter separates signal from noise via its
 * measurement/process model.
 *
 * Cost: BDP lands closer to the physical pipe limit → nearer to
 *   loss thresholds.
 * Gain: avoids the systematic under-filling that min_rtt causes
 *   on real-world paths.
 *
 * (3) ACK aggregation compensation — dual-layer, confidence-gated
 *
 * Layer 1: kcc_ack_aggregation_cwnd()
 *   Applied unconditionally (whenever bdp_ready) — matches kernel
 *   BBR's bbr_ack_aggregation_cwnd().
 *
 * Layer 2: kcc_agg_cwnd_compensation()
 *   Activates only when agg_state >= KCC_AGG_CONFIRMED.
 *   When aggregation is detected, cwnd is expanded to absorb the
 *   aggregation depth.  The confidence gate prevents over-inflation
 *   on ambiguous aggregation signals.
 *   Kernel BBR has no equivalent — it unconditionally adds extra_acked
 *   to the cwnd target.
 *
 * (4) CWND progression policy — BBR's two-phase model
 *
 * full_bw_reached (pipe filled) → convergent growth:
 *   cwnd = min(cwnd + acked, target)
 *   cwnd grows at ACK rate but capped at the BDP target.
 *   This is convergent: cwnd → target, no explosion.
 *
 * STARTUP (pipe not yet full) → exponential probe:
 *   cwnd = cwnd + acked
 *   Each ACK grows cwnd by one segment — effectively slow-start
 *   until full_bw_reached fires or loss occurs.
 *
 * (5) PROBE_RTT cwnd enforcement — independent second pass
 *
 * During PROBE_RTT, cwnd must be held at min_target (4 segments)
 * to probe for a new minimum RTT.  BBR places this check *after*
 * snd_cwnd_clamp — a second, independent cwnd truncation.  Even if
 * the global clamp permits a larger value, PROBE_RTT forces the
 * minimum.
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_set_cwnd().
 * Core logic (steps 1–5) is identical to kernel BBR.

 * has completed (should advance to the next phase).
 *
 * @sk:  TCP socket.
 * @rs:  rate sample.
 * @ext: extended state (for Kalman drain-skip gate).
 *
 * Decision logic (from BBRv1, adapted for KCC gain decay):
 *   1. Phase must have lasted at least one min_rtt (is_full_length).
 *   2. Additional termination conditions depend on pacing_gain:
 *      - gain > 1.0x (probing up):   exit if loss occurred OR
 *                                     inflight_at_edt >= target_inflight.
 *      - gain < 1.0x (probing down): drain-to-target.
 *        Exit when is_full_length AND inflight_at_edt <=
 *        target at 1x gain, with a safety timeout after
 *        KCC_DRAIN_TARGET_MAX_RTTS (default 4) RTTs.
 *        Prevents premature drain exit that leaves
 *        residual inflight on multi-flow paths.
 *      - gain == 1.0x (cruise):      exit when is_full_length.
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_is_next_cycle_phase().
 * Kernel BBR uses the same three-branch dispatch (probe-up, probe-down,
 * cruise) with is_full_length as the base condition.
 *
 * KCC deviations:
 *   a) Probe-up (gain > 1.0x): KCC adds kcc_probe_bw_up_limit exits
 *      (app-limited or empty send queue) when the sysctl is enabled
 *      (default: off).  Kernel BBR exits on loss OR inflight target
 *      only.  The up-limit prevents futile probing when the application
 *      cannot fill the pipe.
 *      WHY: On app-limited connections, 1.25x probing beyond the app's
 *      send rate only inflates the queue without discovering bandwidth.
 *      The up-limit (disabled by default) is a safety valve, not a
 *      behavioural change.
 *   b) Probe-down (gain < 1.0x): KCC replaces BBR's OR-gate
 *      (is_full_length || drained) with an AND-gate + safety timeout
 *      (is_full_length && drained) || timeout.  This fixes BBRv1's
 *      premature drain exit on multi-flow paths (documented in detail
 *      in the inline block comment above the drain-to-target section).
 *      Kernel BBR drains exit when EITHER one RTT has elapsed OR
 *      inflight drops to BDP — whichever comes first.  On multi-flow
 *      paths, a single RTT is insufficient to drain the aggregate queue
 *      from N simultaneous 1.25x probes, causing residual inflight that
 *      accumulates cycle over cycle until loss.
 *      BENEFIT: Eliminates the BBRv1 multi-flow residual-inflight
 *      pathology that causes throughput oscillations of 550-1300 Mbps
 *      on 8-flow, 1 Gbps bottlenecks.
 *   c) Kalman drain-skip: when the Kalman filter is converged and
 *      qdelay_avg < drain_skip_qdelay_us (default 1 ms), the drain
 *      phase is skipped entirely — converted to an early cruise.
 *      Kernel BBR never skips DRAIN.
 *      WHY: The preceding probe did not create standing queue, so
 *      draining is unnecessary.  Skipping DRAIN converts 1/8 of the
 *      cycle to productive cruise bandwidth.
 *      BENEFIT: Converts unproductive drain phases to cruise on
 *      zero-queue paths, increasing throughput by ~1-2% in steady state.
 *
 * Type note: 'delta' is s64 (from tcp_stamp_us_delta) because the
 * timestamp delta may be negative if the monotonic clock was reordered
 * (rare but possible on some kernel/NIC combinations).  s64 delta
 * handles negative values gracefully in the comparison with min_rtt_us
 * (u32).  Returns bool, matching kernel BBR's bbr_is_next_cycle_phase().

         * BBRv1 drain mechanism:
         *
         *   PROBE_UP (1.25x) ─── creates standing queue ───►
         *   DRAIN (0.75x) ─── empties the queue ───►
         *   CRUISE (1.0x) ─── maintains BDP-level inflight
         *
         * In the original BBRv1 (Cardwell et al. 2016), drain
         * exits when EITHER one min_rtt has elapsed OR inflight
         * drops to BDP — whichever comes first:
         *
         *   return is_full_length || (inet_edt <= BDP_target);
         *
         * This is broken on multi-flow paths:
         *
         *   1. Eight flows share a 1 Gbps bottleneck.
         *   2. During PROBE_UP they collectively overshoot, building
         *      a queue that can exceed 1–2× BDP per flow.
         *   3. DRAIN at 0.75× pacing begins.  After 1 RTT, inflight
         *      has only partially drained — residual queue remains
         *      because the aggregate drain rate (8×0.75=6×) cannot
         *      clear 8×BDP of standing queue in a single RTT.
         *   4. The `is_full_length` branch fires.  Drain exits
         *      prematurely.  Residual inflight carries over into
         *      the next cycle.
         *   5. The next PROBE_UP starts from an already-elevated
         *      inflight baseline — overshoot happens earlier and
         *      harder — loss spikes — CWND collapses — throughput
         *      oscillates 550–1300 Mbps within 1–2 seconds.
         *

 *
 * KCC deviation from BBR practice:
 * BBR practice: bbr uses minmax_running_max() for bandwidth estimation,
 * which collapses during sustained loss as old high-bw samples expire.
 * WHY KCC diverges: On policed paths (VPN shapers, ISP throttling, WiFi),
 * the max-bw window drops below the true policed rate after a loss
 * episode, forcing STARTUP re-probing that hits the policer again.
 * LT-BW preserves the policed rate as a stable lower bound, preventing
 * this oscillation.  The consistency check (relative + absolute tolerance)
 * prevents LT-BW from locking onto noise; the queue guard (qdelay_avg or
 * instant qdelay check) ensures LT-BW does not activate during KCC's own
 * congestion (self-inflicted loss), only during policer-limited loss.
 * BENEFIT: Stable send rate through policed loss periods, faster recovery
 * without re-probing into the policer ceiling.  Queue guard prevents
 * death-spiral where LT-BW locks in a low rate caused by KCC's own queue.
 *
 * Type note: 'bw' is u64 because the caller (kcc_lt_bw_sampling) computes
 * interval bandwidth via 64-bit division.  Internally, the function
 * clamps to u32 when storing to kcc->lt_bw.  The consistency comparison
 * uses u64 arithmetic to avoid overflow when multiplying lt_bw by the
 * ratio numerator.  The byte-rate conversion (kcc_rate_bytes_per_sec)
 * also produces u64, preserving precision through the diff comparison.

/*
 * kcc_lt_bw_sampling - Main LT BW sampling state machine, called per-ACK.
 *
 * @sk: TCP socket.
 * @rs: rate sample.
 *
 * Two modes:
 * A) lt_use_bw == 1 (LT BW active):
 *    - Count round trips.  After lt_bw_max_rtts rounds in PROBE_BW,
 *      reset LT BW and mode (periodically re-probe the path).
 *
 * B) lt_use_bw == 0 (not active):
 *    - Sampling triggers on first loss event.
 *    - Collects up to 4 * lt_intvl_min_rtts rounds of data.
 *    - After at least lt_intvl_min_rtts rounds, if loss ratio >= threshold,
 *      compute bw = delivered * BW_UNIT / interval_time and call
 *      kcc_lt_bw_interval_done().
 *
 * Exits: on app_limited, after timeout (4* min_rtts), or on bad timestamp.
 *
 * This is a KCC extension with no direct kernel BBR equivalent.
 * Kernel BBR handles loss by reducing cwnd (in bbr_set_cwnd) but does not
 * maintain a separate long-term bandwidth state machine.  KCC's LT-BW
 * is similar in spirit to BBRv3's LT-BW proposal (preserve a bandwidth
 * floor through lossy intervals), implemented independently.
 *
 * Type note: interval duration t_us is u64 (not u32) because KCC's LT
 * interval parameters are runtime sysctls, not compile-time constants.
 * Kernel BBR's LT timeout (4 * bbr_lt_intvl_min_rtts = 16 RTTs) fits in
 * u32 even after ms→us conversion.  KCC allows up to 32 * 127 = 4064 RTTs,
 * which at 10 s/RTT would overflow u32; hence u64 and div64_u64().
 * See the inline block comment at the bandwidth computation for the
 * detailed overflow analysis.

 * kcc_update_bw - Update the sliding-window max bandwidth estimate.
 *
 * @sk:  TCP socket.
 * @rs:  rate sample from the current ACK.
 * @ext: extended state (unused here, for consistent API with kcc_update_model).
 *
 * Per-ACK updates:
 *   1. Validate the rate sample (interval > 0, delivered >= 0).
 *   2. Detect round boundaries: when prior_delivered >= next_rtt_delivered,
 *      a new round starts.  On round start:
 *        - Increment rtt_cnt.
 *        - Reset packet_conservation (exit recovery mode at round boundary).
 *   3. Run LT BW sampling state machine.
 *   4. Compute instantaneous bw = delivered * BW_UNIT / interval_us.
 *   5. Feed into the sliding-window max via minmax_running_max().
 *      Window length = kcc_bw_rt_cycle_len (default 10 rounds).
 *      If app-limited: only update if new bw >= existing max (BBR rule).
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_update_bw().
 * Identical validation, round-boundary detection, BW computation, and
 * minmax update logic.  The BW formula (delivered * BW_UNIT / interval_us)
 * and the app-limited exclusion rule match kernel BBR exactly.
 *
 * KCC deviations:
 *   a) LT BW sampling: interleaved at step 3 (kernel BBR has no LT-BW).
 *   b) Global Kalman BDP floor: Step 2 (inside the function body) enforces
 *      a defensive BW floor from the global KF estimate during STARTUP,
 *      preventing the first few dirty samples from overwriting the KF
 *      injection.  Kernel BBR has no cross-connection bandwidth sharing.
 *      See kcc_kf_get_init_bw() for the full Global KF mechanism.
 *   BENEFIT of (b): Prevents KF-injected initial bandwidth from being
 *   immediately overwritten by pre-fill low-rate samples.
 *
 * Type note: 'bw' is computed as u64 via div_u64() before being cast to
 * u32 for minmax_running_max().  The u64 intermediate is necessary because
 * delivered * BW_UNIT can exceed U32_MAX on high-speed paths with large
 * ACK coalescing.  The ext parameter is declared for API consistency but
 * unused in this function — it is consumed by kcc_lt_bw_sampling which is
 * called within.

/*
 * kcc_check_full_bw_reached - Detect when the pipe has been filled to
 * capacity (STARTUP -> DRAIN transition criterion).
 *
 * @sk: TCP socket.
 * @rs: rate sample.
 *
 * Algorithm (BBRv1, Cardwell et al. 2016):
 *   - Skip if already full, not at round_start, or app-limited.
 *   - Compute bw_thresh = full_bw * full_bw_threshold (default 1.25x).
 *   - If max_bw >= bw_thresh -> bandwidth still growing; update full_bw.
 *   - Else: increment full_bw_cnt.
 *   - When full_bw_cnt >= full_bw_cnt_val (default 3 rounds without growth):
 *     set full_bw_reached = 1.
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_check_full_bw_reached().
 * Identical growth-detection logic (bw_thresh comparison, full_bw_cnt
 * saturation at 3, threshold at 1.25x).  The same three-skip conditions
 * (already full, not round_start, app-limited) in the same order.
 *
 * KCC deviation: Global Kalman BDP STARTUP protection guard inserted
 * BEFORE the standard skip-check (lines after the function start).  When
 * the global KF is active and the connection is in early STARTUP (rtt_cnt
 * < KCC_KF_STARTUP_PROTECT_RTTS = 8), if max_bw is still at or above the
 * KF floor, the function resets full_bw_cnt = 0 and returns early, keeping
 * STARTUP alive.  This prevents premature full_bw detection on the first
 * few app-limited ACKs that BBR would tolerate but KCC accelerates via
 * the Global KF bandwidth injection.
 * BBR practice: bbr has no cross-connection bandwidth injection and thus
 * no equivalent guard.  App-limited early ACKs gradually build full_bw_cnt
 * and can trigger premature full_bw_reached on idle-start connections.
 * WHY: Without this guard, the Global KF-injected initial bandwidth is
 * interpreted as "pipe already full" by the standard growth check, causing
 * KCC to exit STARTUP before the connection has actually filled the pipe.
 * BENEFIT: Preserves STARTUP probing for the full pipe-filling duration
 * even when the global KF provides a high initial bandwidth estimate.
 *
 * Type note: full_bw_cnt is a u32:2 bitfield (max 3), saturating at 3.
 * full_bw_thresh_val is stored as a precomputed (num/den * BBR_UNIT) value.
 * bw_thresh is u32, computed as (full_bw * thresh_val) >> BBR_SCALE.
 * All types and operations match kernel BBR's bbr_check_full_bw_reached().

 *   - Adaptive R: increased when jitter exceeds threshold.
 *   - Q-boost: resets p_est to p_est_init when innovation is very large

 *   - Outlier gating: rejects samples where |innovation| exceeds a

         *     is large enough to indicate a genuine path change (route

 *   4. Traditional min_rtt window update (only when Kalman has NOT taken over):
 *      - Sticky fall: gradual reduction using sticky_num/sticky_den ratio.
 *      - Fast fall: immediate reduction when rtt < min_rtt / 4 for fast_fall_cnt
 *        consecutive samples.
 *   5. SRTT guard: override min_rtt if SRTT < min_rtt * guard_ratio.
 *   6. PROBE_RTT entry: if filter_expired and not idle_restart and mode != PROBE_RTT.
 *   7. PROBE_RTT management: determine stay period and exit conditions.
 *   8. Kalman takeover: when x_est is valid and sample_cnt >= min_samples,
 *      replace min_rtt_us with x_est / kalman_scale, and compute dynamic
 *      PROBE_RTT interval.
 *
 * NOTE: min_rtt_stamp is NOT refreshed when Kalman sets min_rtt_us,

 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_update_min_rtt().
 * The core PROBE_RTT management (steps 1, 2, 6, 7) is identical.
 *
 * KCC deviations (major):
 *   a) Step 3: Kalman filter update (kcc_kalman_update).  Kernel BBR does
 *      not use a Kalman filter — it relies solely on the sliding-window
 *      minimum and PROBE_RTT drains.  KCC runs the Kalman update on every
 *      valid RTT sample to maintain x_est and p_est.
 *   b) Step 4: Sticky fall and fast fall logic for the sliding-window
 *      min_rtt.  Kernel BBR updates min_rtt_us directly on any smaller
 *      sample (simple min operation).  KCC adds hysteresis to prevent
 *      transient RTT dips from permanently deflating min_rtt_us.  The
 *      sticky ratio (default 0.75) requires multiple consecutive dips
 *      below the threshold before committing the new minimum.  The fast
 *      fall bypass (default rtt < min_rtt / 4) provides an immediate
 *      commit for very large drops (e.g., route change).
 *   c) Step 5: SRTT guard — kernel BBR has no equivalent.  If the
 *      smoothed RTT (SRTT/8) drops below min_rtt * guard_ratio (default
 *      0.90), min_rtt is overridden by SRTT/8.  This prevents min_rtt_us
 *      from becoming stale when the path latency genuinely decreases but
 *      no single RTT sample falls below the old minimum.
 *   d) Step 8: Kalman min-rtt pull-down with hysteresis.  After the
 *      Kalman filter converges (sample_cnt >= min_samples), if x_est is
 *      consistently below min_rtt_us for minrtt_fast_fall_cnt consecutive
 *      rounds, min_rtt_us is replaced by the Kalman estimate.  Kernel
 *      BBR has no Kalman filter and no equivalent mechanism.
 *
 * BENEFIT of (b): Prevents BDP deflation from transient RTT dips on
 * bursty paths (WiFi, cellular).  BENEFIT of (c): Guarantees min_rtt_us
 * tracks genuine path-latency decreases even when no single sample
 * undercuts the old min.  BENEFIT of (d): Kalman's unbiased estimate
 * provides a tighter lower bound than the windowed min, improving BDP
 * accuracy on paths with persistent queue noise.
 *
 * Type note: 'filter_expired' gate uses u32 jiffies arithmetic with the
 * after() macro.  Per-flow jitter is computed from sk->sk_hash (u32) to
 * desynchronise PROBE_RTT entry across flows.  rtt_clamped is u32,
 * floored at 1 us.  All types match kernel BBR's bbr_update_min_rtt().

     *
     * KCC deviates from the kernel in two ways:
     *
     * 1. Per-flow jitter (BBR1 multi-flow fix):
     *
     *    The kernel's static window causes all co-existing flows
     *    sharing a bottleneck to enter PROBE_RTT simultaneously.
     *    N flows simultaneously drain to 4 packets (aggregate ~2*N
     *    Mbps) and then simultaneously refill at 2.89x high_gain,
     *    creating an N× overshoot.  The last flow to complete
     *    refill faces severe congestion and can enter RTO with zero
     *    throughput for seconds.
     *
     *    Per-flow jitter, derived from the stable per-socket hash
     *    (sk->sk_hash), spreads the PROBE_RTT entry window across
     *    0..2× min_rtt_us (0..~744 us at 372 us min_rtt).  At any
     *    instant, at most ~1 flow is in PROBE_RTT, eliminating the
     *    synchronised drain/refill overshoot.
     *
     * 2. Dynamic PROBE_RTT interval (KCC Kalman optimisation):
     *
     *    The kernel uses a fixed 10-second interval regardless of
     *    path stability.  When KCC's Kalman filter is converged
     *    (p_est < kcc_kalman_converged), the state estimate x_est
     *    tracks true propagation delay continuously from every
     *    valid RTT sample.  The periodic PROBE_RTT drain, which
     *    cuts cwnd to 4 segments for 200 ms, becomes unnecessary
     *    overhead — the Kalman filter already maintains an accurate
     *    min_rtt without queue-draining.
     *
     *    The interval extends from the base 10 s to
     *    kcc_probe_rtt_dyn_max_sec (default 30 s) when converged,
     *    reducing throughput dips from ~2 % (200 ms / 10 s) to
     *    ~0.7 % (200 ms / 30 s).  When the filter diverges
     *    (p_est > 4× threshold), the interval shortens to 5 s for
     *    urgent recalibration.

/* ---- ACK Aggregation Compensation (Cardwell et al. 2016) ------------ */

/*
 * kcc_update_ack_aggregation - Track extra ACKed data beyond the bandwidth
 * estimate to compensate for ACK aggregation (delayed/stretched ACKs).
 *
 * @sk:  TCP socket.
 * @rs:  rate sample from this ACK.
 * @ext: extended state (ack epoch tracking fields in struct kcc_ext).
 *
 * Algorithm (dual-window sliding max, inspired by BBRplus):
 *   - Two windows (indices 0 and 1) each spanning approx 5 RTTs.
 *   - Within each window, track the maximum extra_acked value observed.
 *     The effective extra_acked is max(win[0], win[1]).
 *
 * On each ACK:
 *   1. If round_start: increment window RTT counter, rotate windows at 5 RTTs.
 *   2. Compute epoch elapsed time and expected_acked = bw * epoch_us.
 *   3. If expected_acked >= ack_epoch_acked (more expected than received):
 *      reset the epoch (prevents accumulating stale extra_acked).
 *   4. Compute extra_acked = ack_epoch_acked - expected_acked.
 *   5. Update the sliding max in the current window.
 *
 * Epoch reset conditions:
 *   - ack_epoch_acked <= expected_acked (ACKs caught up), OR
 *   - ack_epoch_acked + this_acked >= 1M (epoch cap; prevents overflow).
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_update_ack_aggregation().
 * Kernel BBR uses a similar epoch-based mechanism with a single window.
 * The expected_acked formula and epoch reset logic are identical.
 *
 * KCC deviations:
 *   a) Dual-window sliding max (two alternating windows) instead of
 *      kernel BBR's single-window approach.
 *      BBR practice: bbr_update_ack_aggregation tracks extra_acked in
 *      a single window that is reset every ~5 RTTs.  The reset clears
 *      the accumulated max, causing a cwnd "cliff" at window boundaries.
 *      WHY: Dual windows preserve the peak across window boundaries:
 *      when one window resets, the other still holds the recent peak.
 *      This prevents the cwnd cliff that occurs every 5 RTTs in BBR.
 *      BENEFIT: Smoother cwnd trajectory, no periodic cwnd drops from
 *      window resets.
 *
 *   b) The tracking fields (extra_acked[], ack_epoch_acked, etc.) are
 *      in the heap-allocated kcc_ext rather than bitfields in struct kcc.
 *      Kernel BBR stores extra_acked as a u32 bitfield in struct bbr.
 *      KCC uses kcc_ext because the in-sock CA slot (ICSK_CA_PRIV_SIZE)
 *      is consumed by Kalman-filter state and bitfield packing.
 *      The dual-window array would not fit in the available bitfield
 *      budget.  This is an implementation constraint, not a semantic
 *      deviation.
 *
 * Type note: epoch_us is s64 (from tcp_stamp_us_delta) to handle
 * potential monotonic clock reordering gracefully.  Clamped to 0 if
 * negative.  expected_acked is u32, capped at U32_MAX if the product
 * (bw * epoch_us) would overflow.  The epoch cap (kcc_ack_epoch_max_val)
 * prevents unbounded accumulation of ack_epoch_acked.

 *
 * @sk:  TCP socket.
 * @ext: extended state (dual-window extra_acked array).
 * @bw:  bandwidth estimate in BW_UNIT (used to compute the max-agg-cwnd cap).
 *
 * Bonus = gain * max(extra_acked[0], extra_acked[1]) / BBR_UNIT.
 * Capped at max_aggr_cwnd = bw * max_ms * 1000 / BW_UNIT (default 100ms worth of data).
 *
 * Returns 0 if aggregation compensation is disabled (gain == 0),
 * full_bw not reached, or ext is NULL.
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_ack_aggregation_cwnd().
 * Identical formula: gain * max_extra_acked >> BBR_SCALE, capped at
 * bw * max_agg_window (kernel BBR uses the same cap with a compile-time
 * window constant).  Both implementations check full_bw_reached and gain
 * before computing the bonus.
 *
 * KCC deviation: dual-window max (max(extra_acked[0], extra_acked[1]))
 * vs. kernel BBR's single-window extra_acked.  See kcc_update_ack_aggregation
 * for the rationale on why dual windows prevent cwnd cliffs.
 *
 * Additionally, KCC applies the standard ACK-agg bonus BEFORE the
 * confidence-gated second layer (kcc_agg_cwnd_compensation) in
 * kcc_set_cwnd.  The confidence-gated layer is separate and only
 * activates at high agg_state.  Kernel BBR has no confidence gating.
 *
 * Type note: 'bw' is u32 (BW_UNIT).  Internal multiplication uses u64
 * to prevent overflow of (bw * max_ms * USEC_PER_MSEC).  The cap
 * max_aggr_cwnd is computed as u32 by shifting the u64 product right by
 * BW_SCALE.  Return is u32 (segments of cwnd bonus).

 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_update_model().
 * Kernel BBR's pipeline order is identical (bw update, ack agg, cycle phase,
 * full_bw check, drain check, min_rtt, gain assignment).  KCC interleaves
 * ECN EWMA and single-flow evaluation at the same logical points.
 *
 * KCC deviations:
 *   a) ECN-CE EWMA (step 2b): kernel BBR does not maintain an ECN EWMA.
 *      BBR reacts to ECN per-ACK by reducing cwnd, similar to loss.
 *      KCC's EWMA enables proportional, graduated backoff rather than
 *      binary cwnd reduction.
 *   b) LT BW override in PROBE_BW gain assignment (step 8): when
 *      lt_use_bw is active, pacing_gain is locked at BBR_UNIT (1.0x)
 *      matching kernel BBR's behaviour exactly.
 *   c) Single-flow heuristic evaluation (step 9): kernel BBR has no
 *      equivalent alone_on_path detection.
 *
 * Type note: 'ext' may be NULL.  All sub-functions in the pipeline handle
 * NULL ext gracefully by falling back to no-Kalman-operation.  The gain
 * assignment switch uses bitfield reads for kcc->mode, kcc->cycle_idx,
 * etc.  Gains (kcc->pacing_gain, kcc->cwnd_gain) are u32:10 bitfields,
 * assigned from precomputed module-parameter caches (kcc_high_gain_val,
 * etc.) which are already in BBR_UNIT scale.

/* ---- Main Per-ACK Entry Point ----------------------------------------- */

/*
 * kcc_main - Main congestion control callback invoked on each ACK.
 *
 * @sk:  TCP socket.
 * @rs:  rate sample (delivered, interval_us, rtt_us, losses, etc.).
 * @ack: (kernel 6.10+ only) ACK number.
 * @flags: (kernel 6.10+ only) ACK flags.
 *
 * Processing sequence:
 *   1. ACK aggregation confidence evaluation (runs BEFORE model update
 *      so the Kalman filter sees fresh agg_confidence on the same ACK).
 *   2. Global Kalman BDP: feed PROBE_BW cruise-phase samples into the
 *      cross-connection bandwidth estimator.
 *   3. Run kcc_update_model (bandwidth/RTT/loss/Kalman/gain updates).
 *   4. Apply cwnd constraints (ECN backoff, etc.).
 *   5. Set pacing rate using current bw and pacing_gain.
 *   6. Set cwnd using current bw and cwnd_gain.
 *
 * This function reads global module-parameter caches (e.g. kcc_cwnd_gain_val,
 * kcc_kalman_q_val) without READ_ONCE.  This is deliberate:
 *   - A stale value affects at most one ACK; the next ACK corrects it.
 *   - All kernel CC modules (BBR, CUBIC, Westwood, etc.) do the same.
 *   - See "CONCURRENCY & SAFETY MODEL" at struct kcc_ext for the full
 *     justification.
 *
 * This is the single entry point for all KCC per-ACK processing.
 * The function is marked KCC_KFUNC for BPF struct_ops compatibility.
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_main().
 * Kernel BBR's bbr_main() sequence is: bbr_update_model, bbr_set_pacing_rate,
 * bbr_set_cwnd — identical steps 3, 5, 6 in the same order.
 *
 * KCC deviations:
 *   a) Step 1 (ACK aggregation confidence evaluation): kernel BBR does not
 *      have a confidence-gated aggregation system.  BBR's bbr_main() calls
 *      bbr_update_ack_aggregation() and bbr_ack_aggregation_cwnd() within
 *      bbr_update_model() and bbr_set_cwnd() respectively.  KCC evaluates
 *      agg_confidence BEFORE the model update so that the Kalman filter
 *      sees the updated agg_r_scaled (measurement noise inflation) on the
 *      same ACK where aggregation is detected, avoiding a 1-ACK lag.
 *   b) Step 2 (Global Kalman BDP): kernel BBR has no cross-connection
 *      bandwidth sharing.  KCC feeds cruise-phase BW samples into the
 *      global KF to maintain a shared estimate of available bottleneck
 *      bandwidth.  See kcc_kf_update for details.
 *   c) Step 4 (cwnd constraints via kcc_apply_cwnd_constraints): kernel
 *      BBR does not apply ECN EWMA-based backoff to cwnd_gain.  BBR reacts
 *      to ECN per-ACK through the standard TCP cwnd reduction path.
 *   BENEFIT of (a): Aligned detection and compensation on the same ACK;
 *   prevents one-ACK window where the Kalman filter over-trusts an
 *   aggregated RTT sample.  BENEFIT of (b): Fair-share initial bandwidth
 *   for new connections on shared bottlenecks.  BENEFIT of (c): Proactive,
 *   graduated ECN response versus BBR's reactive per-ACK reduction.
 *
 * Type note: The function signature varies by kernel version (6.10+ adds
 * ack and flags parameters).  Both signatures are wrapped by KCC_KFUNC
 * for BPF struct_ops.  The rate_sample parameter 'rs' is const* in both
 * versions, matching kernel BBR's bbr_main() signature.

/*
 * kcc_init - Initialize per-connection KCC state when a connection starts
 * using the "kcc" congestion-control algorithm.
 *
 * @sk: TCP socket.
 *
 * Steps:
 *   1. Zero-initialize the struct kcc (ICSK_CA_PRIV slot).
 *   2. Set prev_ca_state = TCP_CA_Open.
 *   3. Bootstrap min_rtt_us from the TCP stack's recorded min RTT.
 *   4. Set min_rtt_stamp to now.
 *   5. Initialize pacing rate from cwnd and SRTT.
 *   6. Enable pacing on the socket.
 *   7. (KCC extension) Global Kalman BDP injection: if the cross-connection
 *      KF has a valid estimate, seed the bandwidth tracker and set initial
 *      cwnd/pacing to the fair-share rate, bypassing cold-start ramp-up.
 *   8. Allocate and initialize extended state (struct kcc_ext) on the heap.
 *      On allocation failure, KCC runs without Kalman/ACK-agg features
 *      (fallback to sliding-window-only min_rtt).
 *
 * Corresponds to kernel BBR v5.4: bbr_init().
 * The core initialisation steps 1-6 match kernel BBR's bbr_init() exactly:
 * memset, snd_ssthresh = TCP_INFINITE_SSTHRESH, prev_ca_state = Open,
 * next_rtt_delivered = 0, min_rtt_us from tcp_min_rtt, min_rtt_stamp,
 * kcc_init_pacing_rate_from_rtt(), and sk_pacing_status enable.
 *
 * KCC deviations:
 *   a) Step 7 (Global Kalman BDP injection): kernel BBR has no
 *      cross-connection bandwidth sharing.  When kcc_kf_enable is active
 *      and the global KF has converged, kcc_init() seeds the sliding-window
 *      max-bw filter, the pacing rate, and the initial cwnd from the
 *      global fair-share estimate.  This enables "dessert-speed" startup
 *      at the fair-share rate without the multi-RTT ramp-up of cold TCP.
 *      WHY: On shared bottlenecks, each new BBR connection spends 2-4 RTTs
 *      in STARTUP before reaching the fair-share rate.  With many short
 *      connections, this wastes bottleneck capacity and increases latency.
 *      The global KF provides a common fair-share estimate learned from
 *      all connections, allowing new connections to start at the correct
 *      rate immediately.
 *      BENEFIT: Near-zero cold-start penalty for short connections on
 *      shared bottlenecks.  STARTUP probes above the fair-share rate if
 *      additional capacity is available, so the KF injection is a floor,
 *      not a ceiling.
 *   b) Step 8: Extended state allocation on the heap (struct kcc_ext).
 *      Kernel BBR stores all state in the in-sock ICSK_CA_PRIV slot (struct
 *      bbr, 104 bytes on x86_64).  KCC's Kalman filter, ECN EWMA, ACK-agg
 *      confidence, and dynamically computed fields exceed this budget, so
 *      extended state is heap-allocated.  On kzalloc failure, KCC degrades
 *      gracefully to sliding-window-only min_rtt (no Kalman, no ACK-agg
 *      confidence, no ECN EWMA, no single-flow detection).
 *      WHILE neither function exists as a separate function in KCC, the
 *      two reset behaviours (re-enter STARTUP vs. enter PROBE_BW) that
 *      BBR splits into bbr_reset_startup_mode and bbr_reset_probe_bw_mode
 *      are both handled by kcc_reset_mode() with the full_bw_reached branch.
 *      BENEFIT: Graceful degradation on memory pressure; full feature set
 *      when allocation succeeds.
 *
 * Type note: struct kcc is zeroed via memset, which also zeros all bitfields
 * (mode = KCC_STARTUP = 0, flags = 0).  snd_ssthresh is set to
 * TCP_INFINITE_SSTHRESH to prevent the stack from imposing its own cwnd
 * clamp.  min_rtt_us is u32, initialised from tcp_min_rtt() which returns
 * u32.  Extended state is allocated with GFP_KERNEL (may sleep).  The
 * function is marked KCC_KFUNC for BPF struct_ops compatibility.

     * The fallback was originally gated on kcc_kf_enable_val — it existed
     * to give KF-injected init_bw a companion RTT for BDP cwnd seeding.
     * When KF is disabled (default), tcp_min_rtt() almost always yields a
     * valid 3WHS sample and this fallback is never needed in normal operation.
     *
     * However, removing the guard outright is deliberate: if tcp_min_rtt()
     * ever returns 0 in the rare case (no 3WHS RTT measurement), a stuck
     * min_rtt_us == 0 cascades as follows:
     *
     *   kcc_bdp(): KCC_MIN_RTT_UNINIT is U32_MAX, not 0 → the guard at
     *     ~3408 does NOT catch min_rtt_us == 0.  The BDP floor
     *     (kcc_bdp_min_rtt_us_val, default 1 us) inflates model_rtt,
     *     producing a grossly inflated BDP that starves cwnd.
     *   kcc_update_min_rtt(): the SRTT guard (~5995 tests
     *     kcc->min_rtt_us as a boolean) and sticky-ratio logic both skip
     *     — no secondary rescue from normal RTT samples.
     *   Kalman cold-start ceiling (~5300): if min_rtt_us == 0 the
     *     x_est ≤ ceiling check would zero a non-zero x_est (ceiling =
     *     0 << shift = 0, but x_est was seeded from the first
     *     measurement) — actively destructive rather than harmless.
     *
     * The connection crawls until the PROBE_RTT filter expires (~10 s
     * default) and forces min_rtt_us = rtt_clamped at the "normal
     * update" path (~5973).  The cost of the unconditional fallback is

 * ---- BTF kfunc Registration (for BPF struct_ops) ----------------------
 *
 * On kernels >= 5.16, KCC registers its callback functions as BTF kfuncs
 * so that BPF struct_ops programs can invoke them.
 *
 * The BTF set macros vary by kernel version:
 *   6.9+: BTF_KFUNCS_START / BTF_KFUNCS_END
 *   6.0+: BTF_SET8_START / BTF_SET8_END
 *   5.16+: BTF_SET_START / BTF_SET_END
 *
 * Additionally, 6.0+ uses BTF_ID_FLAGS with the 'func' flag; pre-6.0
 * uses BTF_ID.  The registration is gated on CONFIG_X86 and
 * CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE (required for kfunc infrastructure on x86).
 *
 * On 5.18+ the set is registered via register_btf_kfunc_id_set();
 * on 5.16-5.17 it uses register_kfunc_btf_id_set() with a different API.

 *   2. Seed kcc_gain_num[] / kcc_gain_den[] with BBRv1 defaults (Cardwell et al. 2016):
 *      [5/4, 3/4, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1] repeated across 256 slots.
 *      This ensures sysctl reports real values from the start.
 *   3. Call kcc_init_module_params() to clamp and compute all derived values.
 *   4. Register sysctl interface under /proc/sys/net/kcc/.
 *   5. Register BTF kfunc set for BPF struct_ops (5.16+, 5.18+).
 *   6. Register the congestion_control ops with the TCP stack.

 * Cleanup on failure: unregister_sysctl -> return error.
