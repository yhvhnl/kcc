# TCP KCC v1.0 (Kalman Congestion Control)

TCP congestion control module for shared-bandwidth VPS environments combining the BBRv1 state machine with a Kalman filter for propagation-delay estimation.

## Design Principles

Congestion control algorithms must balance throughput, latency, fairness, and loss tolerance. KCC takes a pragmatic approach:

1. **BBRv1 provides a proven foundation.** State machine, pacing, cycle gains, STARTUP/DRAIN/PROBE_BW/PROBE_RTT — KCC adopts these mechanisms without modification.

2. **The Kalman filter improves estimation accuracy.** Separating true propagation delay from queuing delay and jitter yields a more accurate min_rtt estimate, enabling tighter BDP calculation, better-calibrated CWND, and more stable pacing.

3. **Inter-algorithm dynamics follow standard TCP competitive equilibrium.** KCC does not artificially limit its send rate in response to queue detected from external flows. Gain decay (queue-based probe reduction) is available as opt-in via `kcc_cycle_decay_mask` but disabled by default to preserve full probe intensity.

4. **Intra-KCC fairness is actively maintained.** Kalman convergence ensures KCC flows on the same host share a consistent min_rtt estimate, eliminating the winner-takes-all feedback loop that causes severe unfairness in pure BBR multi-flow deployments.

## Algorithm Overview

TCP KCC implements a sender-side congestion control module for the Linux kernel as a loadable `tcp_kcc.ko`. The congestion control function `kcc_main()` is invoked on each ACK from `tcp_ack()`, receiving a `rate_sample` structure that contains kernel-level bandwidth and RTT samples along with delivery and loss counts. The algorithm operates in two temporal regimes: a **per-ACK fast path** that updates measurement state and computes instantaneous pacing and window targets, and a **per-round slower path** that evaluates state-transition conditions and recomputes gains.

The core measurement pipeline consists of two components:

1. **Sliding-window maximum bandwidth filter** (`minmax_running_max` from `linux/win_minmax.h`): window covering the last `kcc_bw_rt_cycle_len` (default 10) round trips. Provides the BBR-compatible `max_bw` estimate.

2. **Kalman filter propagation-delay estimator**: replaces BBRv1's sliding-window minimum RTT, and is the default source for the BDP RTT estimate (see [Model RTT Strategy](#model-rtt-strategy)). A single-state Kalman filter (Kalman 1960) operating in `kcc_kalman_scale` × µs fixed-point units, modeling the true propagation delay as a random walk:
   - State: `x[k] = x[k−1] + w[k]`, `w ~ N(0, Q)`
   - Observation: `z[k] = x[k] + v[k]`, `v ~ N(0, R)`

Fixed-point conventions: `BW_UNIT = 1 << 24` for bandwidth (segments * 2^24 / µs), `BBR_UNIT = 1 << 8 = 256` as the dimensionless gain unit.

## Model RTT Strategy

KCC introduces a configurable strategy for the RTT estimate used in BDP (Bandwidth-Delay Product) calculation, controlled by `kcc_rtt_mode`:

| Mode | Value | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| FILTER | 1 (default) | Use `x_est_us` directly — the raw Kalman/sliding-window filter estimate | Production WAN/VPS: resilient to route changes, zero-throughput-cliff |
| MIN | 0 | `min(x_est_us, min_rtt_us)` — clamp Kalman estimate against windowed minimum | Kernel-module stability verification; static-RTT links |

**Why FILTER is the default:**

- **Route-change resilience**: When a BGP reroute increases physical RTT (e.g., 50 ms → 100 ms), the Kalman gain K_k reacts within a few RTTs and pulls the estimate to the new path latency. MIN mode deadlocks on the old `min_rtt_us` until the window expires, cutting BDP in half.

- **Built-in defenses**: Outlier gating rejects queue-spike samples before they enter the filter. Adaptive Q/R noise estimation reduces Kalman gain when the network is noisy, so the filter naturally distrusts transient queue-bloat and keeps the estimate near true propagation delay.

- **PROBE_RTT decoupling**: FILTER mode enables the `kcc_probe_rtt_decouple` feature — the Kalman filter tracks the RTT floor without requiring the periodic 4-packet drain.

Runtime switch: `echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/kcc/kcc_rtt_mode` to revert to MIN mode.

## State Machine

```
    ┌───> STARTUP ────┐
    │       │         │

    │     DRAIN  ─────┤

    │      └────┘
    │
    └─── PROBE_RTT <──┘
```

Four modes encoded as the 2-bit `mode` field in `struct KCC`:

- **STARTUP (0)**: Initial state. pacing_gain ≈ 2.885x (`kcc_high_gain_val`), cwnd_gain also 2.885x. Exponential bandwidth probing.
- **DRAIN (1)**: Entered after STARTUP exit. pacing_gain ≈ 0.347x (`kcc_drain_gain_val`), cwnd_gain remains 2.885x. Drains the queue accumulated during STARTUP.
- **PROBE_BW (2)**: Steady state. Cycles through a 256-slot gain table (default 8-phase pattern repeated: 1.25x/0.75x/8×1.0x).
- **PROBE_RTT (3)**: Periodically drains inflight to `kcc_cwnd_min_target` (default 4 segments) to obtain a fresh RTT sample.

### STARTUP → DRAIN

Triggered when `full_bw_reached` is set — after `kcc_full_bw_cnt` (default 3) consecutive rounds where `max_bw` fails to grow by at least `kcc_full_bw_thresh_val` (default 1.25x) compared to the previously observed peak. The BDP at 1.0x gain is written to `snd_ssthresh`. `qdelay_avg` is reset to zero to prevent the STARTUP queue buildup from affecting PROBE_BW.

### DRAIN → PROBE_BW

Triggered when estimated inflight-at-EDT ≤ target inflight at 1.0x BDP gain. **Drain-skip optimization**: when the Kalman filter is converged AND `qdelay_avg` is below `kcc_drain_skip_qdelay_us` (default 1000 µs), the DRAIN phase is skipped — converts early to PROBE_BW.

On PROBE_BW entry, the cycle phase index is randomized: `cycle_idx = len − 1 − rand(kcc_probe_bw_cycle_rand)` (default `len − 1 − rand(8)`), which decorrelates concurrent flows sharing a bottleneck link.

### PROBE_BW → PROBE_RTT

Triggered when the PROBE_RTT filter interval expires — the timestamp `min_rtt_stamp` has not been updated within the computed interval. cwnd is saved in `prior_cwnd`, pacing set to drain.

### PROBE_RTT → PROBE_BW

After inflight drops to `kcc_cwnd_min_target` or a round boundary is observed, persists for at least `kcc_probe_rtt_mode_ms_val` (default 200 ms) and at least one full round observed, then exits. cwnd is restored to at least `prior_cwnd`, pacing is temporarily overridden with `kcc_high_gain_val` for rapid pipe refill.

### Recovery & Loss

- On TCP_CA_Loss: `full_bw` and `full_bw_cnt` reset, `round_start` set to 1, `packet_conservation` cleared to 0. If LT BW is not active, injects a synthetic loss event to trigger LT sampling.
- Recovery entry (TCP_CA_Recovery): `packet_conservation` enabled, cwnd = inflight + acked.
- Recovery exit: restored to `prior_cwnd`, `packet_conservation` cleared.
- `kcc_undo_cwnd()`: resets `full_bw` and `full_bw_cnt` (preserving `full_bw_reached`), clears LT BW state.

### Round Detection (BBR Alignment)

`next_rtt_delivered` is initialized to 0 (matching stock BBR; Cardwell et al. 2016), so the first ACK immediately starts round 1 detection without a synthetic offset. Round boundaries are detected when `prior_delivered >= next_rtt_delivered`, with the `interval_us <= 0` guard matching BBR's `delivered < 0 || interval_us <= 0` — catching both zero and negative intervals that would otherwise corrupt the measurement pipeline.

## Core Measurements

### Bandwidth Estimation

Sliding-window max bandwidth filter (`minmax_running_max` from `linux/win_minmax.h`) over `kcc_bw_rt_cycle_len` (default 10) rounds. Instantaneous bw = `delivered × BW_UNIT / interval_us` computed per ACK. Fed into the sliding window only when not app-limited or when bw ≥ current max (BBR rule).

When `lt_use_bw` is active, the active bandwidth estimate switches to `lt_bw` (Long-Term bandwidth estimate).

### Kalman Filter

Single-state scalar Kalman recursion (O(1) complexity):

```
Predict:
  x_pred = x_est          (identity state transition)
  p_pred = p_est + Q      (covariance prediction)

Update:
  innov   = z − x_pred    (innovation)
  K       = p_pred / (p_pred + R)   (Kalman gain [0,1])
  x_est   = x_pred + K × innov      (state update)
  p_est   = (1 − K) × p_pred        (posterior covariance)
```

**Adaptive process noise Q**:
```
Q_base   = kcc_kalman_q (default 100)
q_factor = max(kcc_kalman_q_min_factor_val, min_rtt_us / kcc_kalman_q_rtt_div)
Q        = min(Q_base × q_factor, Q_base × kcc_kalman_q_scale_cap)
Q        = min(Q, kcc_kalman_q_max)
```

**Adaptive measurement noise R**:
```
R = R_base + max(0, jitter_ewma − kcc_jitter_r_thresh_us) × R_base / kcc_jitter_r_scale
R = min(R, R_base × kcc_kalman_r_max_boost)
```

**Q-Boost path-change detection**: when `|innovation| > kcc_kalman_q_boost_thresh_val` (default ≈ 4 ms RTT shift) AND the filter has converged (`p_est ≤ kcc_kalman_converged_p_est_val`, default 500), `p_est` is reset to `kcc_kalman_p_est_init_val`, boosting Kalman gain toward 1.0 for rapid convergence.  A cooldown of `kcc_kalman_qboost_cdwn` (default 15) samples between successive qboost events prevents runaway triggering on lossy paths with high RTT jitter.

**Outlier gating**: dynamic threshold `dyn_thresh = max(outlier_ms × 1000 × scale, jitter_ewma × outlier_jitter_mult × scale)`. Applied only when `p_pred ≤ kcc_kalman_converged_p_est_val`. After `kcc_kalman_max_consec_reject` (default 25) consecutive rejections, the next sample is force-accepted to prevent self-reinforcing lock-in.

**Covariance-matched noise estimation (BBR-S)**: `q_est = (1−α) × q_est + α × (K × innov)²`, `r_est = (1−β) × r_est + β × max(0, innov² − p_pred)`. Combination mode: mode 0 = heuristic only, mode 1 = max (default), mode 2 = weighted blend.

**Kalman takeover**: when `x_est > 0` and `sample_cnt ≥ kcc_kalman_min_samples` (default 5), `min_rtt_us` is replaced by `x_est / kcc_kalman_scale`. `min_rtt_stamp` is not updated — PROBE_RTT interval trigger remains independent.

**Model RTT strategy**: The RTT estimate used for BDP calculation is controlled by `kcc_rtt_mode`. In FILTER mode (default), `model_rtt = x_est_us` directly — the Kalman/sliding-window estimate is used without clamping. In MIN mode, `model_rtt = min(x_est_us, min_rtt_us)` — the Kalman estimate is clamped against the windowed minimum to guarantee BDP never inflates. The FILTER default is recommended for production WAN/VPS deployments where path latency can change abruptly (BGP reroutes, LEO handovers, mobile cell switches). See [Model RTT Strategy](#model-rtt-strategy).

## BBR Enhancements

### Gain Decay

Enabled by the 256-bit bitmap `kcc_cycle_decay_mask[]` for specific PROBE_BW phases. Decay formula (on accepted Kalman sample):

```
max_red       = probe_gain − BBR_UNIT
conf_scale    = inverse scaling of p_est (BBR_UNIT at full)
qdelay_decay  = min(max(0, qdelay_avg − qthresh) × BBR_UNIT / qscale, max_red)
                    × conf_scale / BBR_UNIT
jitter_decay  = min(max(0, jitter_ewma − jthresh) × BBR_UNIT / jscale, remaining)
                    × conf_scale / BBR_UNIT
effective     = max(probe_gain − qdelay_decay − jitter_decay, BBR_UNIT)
```

Kalman confidence scaling: when `p_est > kcc_kalman_converged_p_est`, decay is proportionally reduced, avoiding excessive backoff when the filter is uncertain.

### ECN Backoff

Activation conditions (all must hold):
1. `kcc_ecn_enable_val != 0`
2. Kalman converged (`p_est < converged`, `sample_cnt >= min_samples`)
3. `ecn_ewma > 0` (CE marks observed)
4. `qdelay_avg > kcc_ecn_qdelay_thresh_us_val` (default 2000 µs)
5. Mode is NOT PROBE_BW (cwnd_gain is fixed at 2x in PROBE_BW)

During probing phases (`pacing_gain > BBR_UNIT`), ECN backoff is graduated by `BBR_UNIT² / pacing_gain` — ~80% of backoff at 1.25x probe, ~65% at 2.89x STARTUP gain.

ECN mark ratio EWMA: updated on round boundaries by `kcc_ecn_ewma_retained / kcc_ecn_ewma_total` (default 3/4), with gentle per-ACK decay of `kcc_ecn_idle_decay_num / kcc_ecn_idle_decay_den` (default 31/32) on each ACK with no new CE marks.

### Single-Flow Detection

When KCC detects the flow is likely alone on the bottleneck (low queue delay, low jitter, no ECN marks, no ACK aggregation, no LT bandwidth), it automatically transitions to a BBR-pure mode:

- `kcc_get_model_rtt()` returns `min_rtt_us` directly (bypassing the Kalman smoothed estimate, which has a small positive bias from one-sided measurement noise).
- `kcc_ecn_backoff()` is skipped when `kcc_alone_bypass_ecn = 1` (default), matching BBR's zero-ECN behavior. On a single-flow path there is no competing sender to share ECN marks with — any marks are false positives. Set `kcc_alone_bypass_ecn = 0` to keep ECN backoff active even when alone (conservative).
- LT BW (policer-detected rate limit) qualification is configurable via `kcc_alone_bypass_lt_bw` (default 1). A single-flow path has no policer, so LT BW cannot legitimately activate. Setting it to 1 prevents spurious alone-mode exit from false LT BW triggers. Set to 0 for original strict behavior.

This eliminates the single-flow throughput gap between KCC and BBR while preserving KCC's full protection loop (Kalman, ECN backoff, gain decay, LT bandwidth) for multi-flow scenarios.

**Hysteresis**: Entry requires `kcc_alone_confirm_rounds` (default 3) consecutive qualifying rounds — preventing oscillation during brief quiet periods in multi-flow competition ("conservative to accelerate"). Exit is immediate — any qualification failure clears the flag and resets the confirmation counter ("aggressive to brake"). The confirmation counter is a `u8` bounded to `KCC_ALONE_CONFIRM_CNT_MAX` (255, compile-time).

Qualification conditions (all six must hold on a round boundary):
0. Kalman converged (`sample_cnt >= kcc_kalman_min_samples`) — trust qdelay/jitter as queue signals
1. `qdelay_avg < kcc_alone_qdelay_thresh_us` (default 1000 us) — near-empty queue
2. `jitter_ewma < kcc_alone_jitter_thresh_us` (default 2000 us) — ACK-clock micro-jitter only
3. `ecn_ewma == 0` — no congestion marks from AQM
4. `lt_use_bw == 0` — not in policer-detected rate-limited mode
5. `agg_state <= max` per `kcc_alone_agg_state_level` (default 1) — three-tier configurable:
   - 0 = IDLE only (strictest), 1 = ≤ SUSPECTED (default), 2 = ≤ CONFIRMED (most permissive)

### Dynamic PROBE_RTT Interval

Maps Kalman `p_est` to a per-connection PROBE_RTT interval:

```
p_est ≤ converged:              interval = dyn_max (default 30s)
p_est ≥ high (= mult × conv):   interval = base (default 10s)
converged < p_est < high:       linear interpolation
```

Reduces PROBE_RTT frequency when confidence is high (low `p_est`), lowering throughput jitter on stable paths. Reverts to classic 10-second interval when confidence is low.

**Per-flow entry jitter**: To prevent all co-existing flows from entering PROBE_RTT simultaneously (draining to 4 pkts aggregate ~1.8 Mbps then refilling at 2.89×), each flow adds a hash-derived jitter (0–845 ms spread) to its PROBE_RTT interval. At most ~1 flow is in PROBE_RTT at any instant, eliminating the RTO-inducing simultaneous drain/refill collapse.

### PROBE_RTT Decoupling & Smart Recalibration

BBRv1's PROBE_RTT mechanism drains the pipe to 4 packets every ~10 seconds to measure `min_rtt_us`. This is necessary for a window-based min-RTT estimator — the window cannot distinguish propagation delay from queueing delay unless the pipe is empty. The cost is a periodic throughput cliff (the BBR "sawtooth").

In FILTER mode, the Kalman filter replaces the window entirely. It can separate queueing noise from true propagation delay through outlier gating and adaptive noise estimation — no pipe drain required. The parameter `kcc_probe_rtt_decouple` (default 1) controls this:

| Mode | Value | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| Decoupled | 1 (default) | **Kalman healthy** (p_est ≤ `kcc_recal_p_est_thresh`): suppress PROBE_RTT entirely → zero throughput cliffs, zero sync collapses. **Kalman diverged** (p_est > threshold): auto-trigger traditional PROBE_RTT as a safety net → restores filter baseline, then decoupling resumes. |
| Traditional | 0 | Blind periodic PROBE_RTT every ~10s (BBR-compatible). |

**Smart recalibration heuristic** (`kcc_kalman_needs_recalibration()`): In steady-state operation on a stable path, the Kalman error covariance p_est converges to p_est_floor (~4–10), far below the threshold `kcc_recal_p_est_thresh` (250,000 = 25% of p_est_max). A rising p_est signals that the filter's internal model no longer explains observations — typically because the path has materially changed. When p_est exceeds the threshold, a single traditional PROBE_RTT drain restores the filter baseline; the Kalman re-converges and decoupling resumes automatically.

This transforms PROBE_RTT from a **blind periodic self-mutilation** into an **intelligent confidence-driven recalibration** — the protocol only drains the pipe when it has empirical evidence that the filter has lost confidence.

Requires `kcc_rtt_mode == 1`. No-op in MIN mode (MIN mode depends on PROBE_RTT to refresh `min_rtt_us`).

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `kcc_probe_rtt_decouple` | 1 | 0–1 | Enable PROBE_RTT decoupling (FILTER mode only) |
| `kcc_recal_p_est_thresh` | 250,000 | 1–100,000,000 | p_est threshold for triggered recalibration safety net |

### LT Bandwidth Estimation

Loss-triggered lower-bound estimator. Sampling interval spans [4, 16] RTTs. Valid when loss ratio ≥ 5.9% (`kcc_lt_loss_thresh` default 15/256). Bandwidth `bw = delivered × BW_UNIT / interval_us`.

Unlike BBR's simple average (`(bw + lt_bw) >> 1`), KCC uses a configurable EMA (`kcc_lt_bw_ema_num / kcc_lt_bw_ema_den`, default 1/2 = 0.5):

```
lt_bw = (bw_new × en + lt_bw × (ed − en)) / ed
```

Activation differs from BBR: KCC stores `lt_bw` on the first valid interval but does NOT set `lt_use_bw`; consistency with a previous interval is required — reduces false activation from measurement noise.

**Dual-threshold congestion gate**: Before setting `lt_use_bw = 1`, both a persistent EWMA queue check (`qdelay_avg > kcc_ecn_qdelay_thresh_us_val`) AND an instantaneous SRTT-based queue check (`srtt_us − min_rtt_us > kcc_lt_bw_inst_qdelay_thresh_us`, default 5000 µs) are evaluated. When congestion is detected, LT BW sampling is aborted. The SRTT check works without `ext` allocation, providing a safety net against allocation failure.

LT BW probe boost (`kcc_lt_bw_probe_pct`, default 10%): amplifies pacing_gain by `1 + probe_pct/100` across all PROBE_BW phases. Ramp component: `+1% per 8 RTTs` increase, capped at `2 × probe_pct`.

LT BW auto-recovery (`kcc_lt_restore_ratio_num/den`, default 5/4 = 1.25x): when `max_bw > lt_bw × ratio` for `kcc_lt_restore_consec_acks` (default 3) consecutive ACKs, LT BW automatically exits and normal PROBE_BW probing resumes. The `lt_restore_cnt` counter is a 5-bit field bounded to `KCC_LT_RESTORE_CNT_MAX` (31, compile-time).

### ACK Aggregation Confidence-Based Compensation (BBRplus-inspired)

Adds a confidence-gated second layer over the traditional dual-slot extra-acked estimator.

**Four orthogonal factors** (each contributes `kcc_agg_factor_weight` points, default 256):
1. Kalman converged (`p_est < converged` + `sample_cnt >= min_samples`)
2. Not in loss recovery (`icsk_ca_state < TCP_CA_Recovery`)
3. RTT within `min_rtt_us + kcc_agg_factor3_qdelay_us` (default 2ms) of true propagation delay
4. `extra_acked` within `kcc_agg_factor4_ratio_num/den` (default 1.5x) of windowed maximum

**Four states**: IDLE (< `kcc_agg_thresh_suspected`=256), SUSPECTED (≥256), CONFIRMED (≥512), TRUSTED (≥768).

**Signal layer** (always active): confidence linearly interpolates R scaling factor `[r_min, r_max]`. R rises instantly (fast response), decays at `kcc_agg_r_hysteresis`% (default 75% retained, ~4 RTTs to baseline) per RTT.

**Control layer** (`agg_state ≥ CONFIRMED`): five-layer safety-gated cwnd compensation:
1. Blocks if queue delay > `kcc_agg_safety_qdelay_us` (default 4ms)
2. Blocks during loss recovery
3. Blocks if cwnd > `BDP × kcc_agg_safety_bdp_mult` (default 3x)
4. Blocks if inflight > safe cwnd + TSO segs goal
5. Watchdog: demotes CONFIRMED→SUSPECTED after `kcc_agg_max_comp_duration` (default 8) consecutive RTTs

### Drain qdelay_avg Reset

On transition to DRAIN, `qdelay_avg` is reset to zero, preventing the STARTUP queue estimate from persisting into PROBE_BW.

### TSO Divisor Adaptation

`kcc_min_tso_segs()` adjusts the rate threshold divisor based on Kalman state:
- Kalman converged + `jitter_ewma < 1000 µs`: divisor halved (8→4), larger TSO bursts
- `jitter_ewma > 4000 µs`: divisor doubled (8→16), smaller TSO bursts to suppress jitter

## Pacing Rate & Cwnd

### Pacing Rate

```
rate = bw × mss × pacing_gain >> BBR_SCALE      // gain adjustment
rate = rate × USEC_PER_SEC >> BW_SCALE            // convert to bytes/s
rate = rate × margin_div / 100                    // pacing margin (default 1%, matching BBR)
```

Rate changes are applied immediately (no smoothing), matching BBR (Cardwell et al. 2016). After `full_bw_reached`: all rate changes written immediately. In STARTUP/DRAIN: only increases applied (`rate > sk_pacing_rate`).

### Cwnd

```
target = BDP(bw, gain, ext)                       // base BDP
target = quantization_budget(target)              // TSO headroom + even-round + phase-0 bonus
target += ack_agg_bonus + agg_compensation        // ACK aggregation compensation

// cwnd progression
if full_bw_reached:
    cwnd = min(cwnd + acked, target)              // converge to target
else (STARTUP):
    cwnd = cwnd + acked                          // exponential growth

cwnd = max(cwnd, cwnd_min_target)                 // absolute floor 4
PROBE_RTT mode: cwnd = min(cwnd, cwnd_min_target) // minimum inflight
```

## Module Parameters

Parameters are exposed under `/proc/sys/net/kcc/`. Writes trigger `kcc_init_module_params()` (validation + clamping + derived value computation). Array parameter writes trigger `kcc_rebuild_gain_table()`.

## Diagnostics

BBR-compatible diagnostic interface via `ss -i` (`INET_DIAG_BBRINFO`):

```
bbr_bw_lo/bbr_bw_hi: 64-bit bandwidth estimate (bytes/s)
bbr_min_rtt:         current min_rtt_us
bbr_pacing_gain:     current pacing gain (BBR_UNIT, 256=1.0x)
bbr_cwnd_gain:       current cwnd gain (BBR_UNIT)
```

## Usage

```sh
# Compile kernel module
make

# Dev load (insmod, no dependency resolution)
sudo make load

# Install and formal load (modprobe)
sudo make install
sudo make modload

# Unload
sudo make unload

# Select KCC algorithm
echo KCC > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_congestion_control
```

Parameter configuration is via `/proc/sys/net/kcc/`. For example:
```sh
# Enable gain decay on specific PROBE_BW phases
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/kcc/kcc_cycle_decay_mask

# Adjust ECN backoff sensitivity
echo 30 > /proc/sys/net/kcc/kcc_ecn_backoff_num
```

## Concurrency & Safety Model

KCC deliberately does not use READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE or RCU for its own data structures. This design is consistent with all in-kernel CC modules such as BBR and CUBIC.

`kcc_init()` executes in process context (during socket creation), before the socket is exposed to any softirq. `kcc_release()` executes after the kernel guarantees no softirq is still processing this socket's ACKs. A transient stale value of a global module parameter affects at most one ACK, corrected at the next ACK.

The only exception: `sk->sk_pacing_rate` / `sk->sk_pacing_shift` are socket-layer fields that userspace can modify simultaneously via `setsockopt`, so BBR's WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE convention is preserved.

## Performance Summary

Test environment: China → US LAX, 212ms RTT, 8 parallel flows, 26% packet loss, 1 Gbps shared VPS bottleneck.

| Metric | KCC v1.0 | BBR (control) | Delta |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Average throughput | 1,010 Mbps | 937 Mbps | **+7.8%** |
| Intra-KCC unfairness | 3.1× | 6.2× (BBR) | **−50%** |
| Worst single flow | 60.6 Mbps | 30.8 Mbps | **+97%** |
| Retransmits | 150K/10s | 137K/10s | +9.5% |
| R3 stability | 959 Mbps | 883 Mbps | **+8.6%** |

Retransmits are slightly higher — a trade-off consistent with maintaining high link utilisation under loss.  KCC's Kalman-augmented min_rtt estimation provides a more accurate BDP baseline, allowing the algorithm to sustain higher throughput than BBRv1 on the same path.

## Global Kalman BDP — Cross-Connection Bandwidth Injection

KCC v1.0 includes an optional cross-connection Global Kalman Filter that estimates the server's steady-state bottleneck bandwidth.  This estimate is used to bootstrap new connections at a conservatively low "dessert speed" — fast enough to skip cold-start ramp-up, slow enough to avoid overshoot.

### Design Principle

The filter is fed with bandwidth samples from the PROBE\_BW **cruise phase** (gain = 1.0×) of all KCC connections.  Cruise-phase samples are the cleanest signal of true available bandwidth — no 1.25× probe overshoot, no 0.75× drain undershoot.  A one-dimensional random-walk Kalman filter (Kalman 1960) tracks the global steady state.

When a new connection is established, the filter's estimate is used to seed:

| Injected value | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `minmax` (max\_bw tracker) | Seed the sliding-window bandwidth history so the first few dirty ACK samples don't drag it to zero |
| `sk_pacing_rate` | Initial pacing rate at neutral gain (BBR\_UNIT); STARTUP's 2.89× gain is applied on the first ACK |
| `tp->snd_cwnd` | Initial congestion window computed via `kcc_bdp()` at neutral gain |

A defensive floor in `kcc_update_bw` prevents the first few RTTs of low delivery-rate samples from overwriting the injected estimate during STARTUP.  A full-BW guard in `kcc_check_full_bw_reached` prevents the iperf3 control-message exchange from prematurely terminating STARTUP.

### Dessert-Speed Discount Ratio

The effective injection speed is:

```
coeff = (discount_ratio) / high_gain
      = (num / den) / 2.89
```

where `high_gain ≈ 2.89` is the BBR STARTUP pacing multiplier.

| num | coeff  | characteristic |
|-----|--------|----------------|
|  35 | 12.1%  | maximum safety, worst-path |
|  50 | 17.3%  | centre axis (default) |
|  75 | 25.9%  | mathematical dessert sweet spot |
|  80 | 27.6%  | mathematical rate ceiling (should not exceed) |

**Note:** `tcp_write_xmit` enforces an initial CWND of `TCP_INIT_CWND` (10 segments, ≈15 KB) for every new connection.  CWND only grows when remote ACKs arrive, so the dessert speed is an upper bound on pacing rate — actual throughput is CWND-limited until sufficient ACKs have been received to open the window.

### Configuration

Enable via `sysctl`:

```bash
sysctl -w net.kcc.kcc_kf_enable=1           # master enable (default 1)
sysctl -w net.kcc.kcc_kf_discount_num=50   # dessert-speed numerator (default 50, range 0–100, recommended 35–75)
```

**Key sysctl parameters** (`/proc/sys/net/kcc/`):

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `kcc_kf_enable` | 1 | 0–1 | Master enable for global Kalman BDP injection |
| `kcc_kf_discount_num` | 50 | 0–100 | Dessert-speed numerator (% of fair-share BW) |
| `kcc_kf_discount_den` | 100 | 1–100000 | Dessert-speed denominator |
| `kcc_kf_steady_mode` | 0 | 0/1 | — | Steady-mode: use monotonic peak (kf_x_steady) for init_bw when enabled, ignoring transient KF dips |
| `kcc_kf_startup_r_pct` | 20 | 1–100 | Measurement noise R% during startup phase |
| `kcc_kf_steady_r_pct` | 5 | 1–100 | Measurement noise R% during steady-state |
| `kcc_kf_q_shift` | 20 | 0–30 | Process noise shift (Q = 1 << shift) |
| `kcc_kf_chi2_num` | 384 | 1–100000 | Chi-squared outlier gate numerator |
| `kcc_kf_chi2_den` | 100 | 1–100000 | Chi-squared outlier gate denominator |

When kcc_kf_steady_mode is enabled (1), the init_bw for new connections uses the monotonically rising peak of the KF estimate (kf_x_steady) instead of the live estimate, which may have drifted downward since the last high-throughput connection. This prevents cold-start starvation on stable paths. The peak is reset to zero when the mode is disabled, giving a clean slate on re-enable.

### First-Second Performance (Trans-Pacific, 212 ms RTT)

```
Without KF:  2.8 Mbps  →  85 Mbps  →  622 Mbps  →  steady
With KF:     50 Mbps   →  530 Mbps  →  650 Mbps  →  steady
```

The first-second speed jumps from ~3 Mbps (cold-start) to ~50 Mbps (dessert-start), and convergence to steady-state is reached within 2–3 seconds.  Retransmissions remain zero throughout.

### How It Works

1. A running KCC connection enters PROBE\_BW cruise phase → round-start boundary → feeds `kcc_kf_update(bw, 5%)` with the current delivery-rate sample.
2. The Kalman filter updates its estimate `kcc_kf_x` (a running average of steady-state bottleneck bandwidth).
3. When a **new** connection opens, `kcc_init` calls `kcc_kf_get_init_bw(sk)` which returns `fair × discount / high_gain` — a gain-compensated, fair-share initial bandwidth estimate.
4. This estimate seeds `sk_pacing_rate`, `tp->snd_cwnd`, and the `minmax` bandwidth tracker — the connection starts at the dessert speed rather than from zero.
